XHR POST Requests I
    The major difference between a GET request and POST request is that a POST request requires additional information to be sent through the request. This additional information is sent in the body of the post request.

    We’ll walk through the code from the diagram and construct our own POST request in the next lesson.
        //XMLHttpRequest POST

        // creates new object
        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        
        const url = 'http://api-to-call.com/endpoint';

        // converts data to a string
        const data = JSON.stringify({id: '200'});


        //handles response
        xhr.responseType = 'json';
        xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
            if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
                //code to execute with response
            }
        };

        // opens request and sends object
        xhr.open('POST', url);
        xhr.send();
        

    We’ll construct this template from scratch in a different exercise and walk through what each step does.
