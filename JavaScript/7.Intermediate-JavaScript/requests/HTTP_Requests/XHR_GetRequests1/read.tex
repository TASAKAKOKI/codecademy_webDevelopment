XHR GET Requests I
    Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), enables requests to be made after the initial page load. Initially, AJAX was used only for XML formatted data, now it can be used to make requests that have many different formats.

    MDN Documentation: Extensible Markup Language (XML).(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XML_introduction)

    Similarly, the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API, named for XML, can be used to make many kinds of requests and supports other forms of data.

    Remember, we use GET to retrieve data from a source. Take a look at the boilerplate code in the diagram to see how to make an XHR GET request.
        //XMLHttpRequest GET

        // create new object
        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        
        const url = 'http://api-to-call.com/endpoint';

        //handles response
        xhr.responseType = 'json';
        xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
            if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
                //code to execute with response
            }
        };

        // opens request and sends object
        xhr.open('GET', url);
        xhr.send();
        

    Weâ€™ll construct this template from scratch in a different exercise and walk through what each step does.
